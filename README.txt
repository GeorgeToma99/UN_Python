# UN Data Analysis: GDP and Internet Usage## IntroductionWelcome to the UN Data Analysis project! We’ve taken a deep dive into Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and Internet usage data from the United Nations. Our aim was to uncover key insights and trends by analyzing and visualizing these datasets. Using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, we tackled data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to better understand global economic and tech developments.## Technologies- Jupyter Notebook- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)## Features- Data cleaning and exploration scripts- Visualizations showing GDP and Internet usage trends- Comparative analysis across different years## Scope- We explored GDP per capita and Internet usage data, focusing on various countries and years to spot interesting trends.- Created visualizations to compare GDP and Internet usage for key years (1990, 2000, 2010, 2020).- Investigated how GDP per capita and Internet usage relate, highlighting notable countries and shifts over time.## Project Status- Completed## Sources- United Nations datasets on:      GDP per capita      Internet usage## Additional InfoThis project was done independently, with a bit of guidance from various resources. All the analysis and visualizations were created to offer a clear view of global economic and tech trends. Check out the Jupyter Notebooks for a detailed look at our findings.
